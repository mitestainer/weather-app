## What this app do? 👓

This app consumes [LocationIQ.com](https://locationiq.com/) and [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) APIs to provide location and weather infos.

The location API gives locations suggestions based on the user's input and provides the coordinates the wetaher API needs to fetch the climate info.

## Known bugs 🐛

- Background is not changing based on current weather (I know I'm missing something... 🤔)
- There's something wrong with the date (it works on OWM site but not here, it messes with today and tomorrow dates when displaying the forecast)
